# Loan-Prediction-in-Python
The loan status in this dataset is the target variable. 
I deployed Decision Tree models to predict the loan status of individuals which is dependent on their income and many such features. 
Used both Gini as well as Entropy models.
Deployed Bagging to increase the efficiency of the model.
